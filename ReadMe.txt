---

## Authentication & Authorization

- Based on **OAuth 2.0** standards
- Implements **JWT Bearer Tokens**
- Token issuance and validation via centralized Auth server
- Supports role-based and policy-based authorization

---

## Supported Databases

- MySQL (relational)
- PostgreSQL (relational)
- MongoDB (NoSQL document store)

---

## Deployment

- Local via Docker Compose
- Cloud-ready: Azure / AWS / GCP / On-prem VMs
- Supports service discovery with [Consul](https://www.consul.io/)
- Configurable CI/CD compatible

---

## Performance Optimization

- Asynchronous programming with minimal thread-blocking
- Caching with **Redis**
- Retry, timeout, and circuit-breaker patterns via Ocelot
- Warm-up routines to reduce cold-start latency

---

## Developer Tooling

- Swagger (OpenAPI) for API documentation
- Serilog / Structured logging
- .env or JSON-based environment configuration
- Built-in health checks and diagnostics

---

## API Gateway

- Built using **Ocelot**
- Dynamically loads and merges routing configuration
- Support for:
  - Load balancing
  - Authorization delegation
  - Custom headers
  - Request/response transformation

---
