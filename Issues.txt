1. OAuth With Jwt Authentication and Authorization
 ==> The Refersh Token Logic Not working automatically when the user's Token Expired
 ==> Also The Users token not storing in the In-Memory, instead we are sending it through Headers of Api Request.
 ==> for first time Request calling , i am Getting 503 service unavailable error. then following it works fine.
 ==> Check Throughly for all Services After the above Issues Fixed.

 2. Gateway Via Middleware 
 ==> the Underlying Services are not to call directly from UI, the request must come from Gateway it works but , i override for Specific routes, that not 
 working.

 ==> also another one problem happening, in SampleAdmin conteoller one Ednpoint Duplicated twice i dont know why.

 ==> /is-running --> while calling this from Gateway itself, i am geting "wrong Message, request must come through Gateway", this should not come here, because i am already calling this from Gateway only.

 3. Gateway Routing Working perfectly in Local browsers, but hosted in Docker, its not working, simillalry need to check with Nginx.

 4. Versioning need to do Properly (IP).
