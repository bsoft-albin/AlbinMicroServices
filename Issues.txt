====== Current Issue Need to Solve =========
1. OAuth With Jwt Authentication and Authorization
 ==> Also The Users token not storing in the In-Memory.

 Authentication now working with Basic Configs
 --> check Roles and Scopes , more powerfully

 additonlly need to do ==> SSO, MFA and Third Party Auths
 FINALLY ==> setting Token only in Backend only ,is this possible , store the Token in HTTPS only Cookie only....

2. Gateway Routing need to check with Nginx.
  
3. Versioning need to do Properly (IP).

4. Docker Side
==> If Possible change the Docker Network name.
==> also change the Overall container name from [my-micros] to some other name.
==> also order the PORT number's of each Services.

5. Structured Logging Need to in this.
