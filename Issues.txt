====== Current Issue Need to Solve =========
1. OAuth With Jwt Authentication and Authorization
 ==> The Refersh Token Logic Not working automatically when the user's Token Expired
 ==> Also The Users token not storing in the In-Memory, instead we are sending it through Headers of Api Request.
 ==> for first time Request calling , i am Getting 503 service unavailable error. then following it works fine.
 ==> Check Throughly for all Services After the above Issues Fixed.

 Authentication now working with Basic Configs
 --> check Roles and Scopes , more powwerfully

 additonlly need to do ==> SSO, MFA and Third Party Auths
 PLUS ==> Refresh Tokens Need to Check Properly working or not
 FINALLY ==> setting Token only in Backend only ,is this possible , store the Token in HTTPS Cookie only....

2. Gateway Routing need to check with Nginx.
  
3. Versioning need to do Properly (IP).

4. Docker Side
==> If Possible change the Docker Network name.
==> also change the Overall container name from [my-micros] to some other name.
==> also order the PORT number's of each Services.

5. Structured Logging Need to in this.

6. In Ocelot, some Problems Coming like, 
 ==> First Hit Takes some Time.
 ==> If the Response time too long, in Gateway getting 503 Service Unavilable instaed of 504 Gateway TimeOUt,
 ==> Some times, not Getting Accurate Statuscode and Message in Gateway , which is sended by Downstream Services.

===== UnExpected Issue happening Some Time ==========
1. One Scenario , i don't know which time, but that time, call come though gateway => says 503 Service unavaible, this comes 
 for First request, but for Subsequent requests it works, I think issue with (Ocelot or My Custom Delete or Custom Middleware).

==== Working By default Wihtout any [External Code] ===========
1. Uri (Case - insensitive Making Needed) ==> (Resolved . by Default , it works for Routes from Gateway, as Well as Direct Downstream Services)
