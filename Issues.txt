====== Current Issue Need to Solve =========
1. OAuth With Jwt Authentication and Authorization
 ==> The Refersh Token Logic Not working automatically when the user's Token Expired
 ==> Also The Users token not storing in the In-Memory, instead we are sending it through Headers of Api Request.
 ==> for first time Request calling , i am Getting 503 service unavailable error. then following it works fine.
 ==> Check Throughly for all Services After the above Issues Fixed.

2. Gateway Routing need to check with Nginx.
  
3. Versioning need to do Properly (IP).

4. Docker Side,
==> If Possible change the Docker Network name.
==> also change the Overall container name from [my-micros] to some other name.
==> also order the PORT number's of each Services.


===== UnExpected Issue happening Some Time ==========
1. One Scenario , i don't know which time, but that time, call come though gateway => says 503 Service unavaible, this comes 
 for First request, but for Subsequent requests it works, I think issue with (Ocelot or My Custom Delete or Custom Middleware).


==== Working By default Wihtout any External Code ===========

1. Uri (Case - insensitive Making Needed) ==> (Resolved . by Default , it works for Routes from Gateway, as Well as Direct Downstream Services)
